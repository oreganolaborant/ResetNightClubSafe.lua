# ResetNightClubSafe.lua
Resets the Nightclub Safe Value to 0 when you have the Bug that it went over 300K by using the SilentNight Script or similar.

This Bug can also happen without Cheating but mostly happens by using a Mod Menu or Script in the Mod Menu.

If the Script doesnt work open the .lua and Change the:

MP0_CLUB_SAFE_VALUE 

to 

MP1_CLUB_SAFE_VALUE
